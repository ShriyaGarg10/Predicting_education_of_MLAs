# Problem Statement
Classification refers to the task of classifying the given data into different categories. For example-

Given a list of emails, classify them as spam or non-spam (Binary Classification)
Given images of handwritten digits, classify them into respective classes 0 to 9 (Multi-Class classification)
If you have seen the “issues” section in a GitHub repository, labeling each issue as a ‘bug’, ‘enhancement’, ‘feature’ etc (Multi-Label Classification)
… and so on.
Elections in the World’s largest democracy are unique worldwide. In this assignment, you are given a dataset of the recent State and UT election winners across India for different states and UTs. The dataset is sourced from the Election Commission of India website. Based on different features, your task is to predict the Education Level of the Winners of the State Elections (Multi-Class Classification).

TASKS -
You are provided with a training dataset and a test dataset. Your main task is to train a machine-learning model of your choice (SVM, KNN, DecisionTree, RandomForest, or any other) on this dataset and perform multi-class classification. You can only use the libraries mentioned in the Rules section. No deep learning methods/libraries are allowed (For example- ANN, Pytorch, Keras, Tensorflow, etc).
